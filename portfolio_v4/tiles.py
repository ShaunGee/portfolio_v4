#this module is used to tiles
'''
This module is going to be used to generate tiles for both the front end and back end of the 
the application. 

reason for this:
create a reusable class to minimise code in other views.py to populate templates with
information from relevant models

take in a model
iterate the model
generate a dictionary of tiles
send them out as context

pseudocode:

class Tile
